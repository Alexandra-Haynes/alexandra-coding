        Afghanistan taught me the power of having a disciplined teammate, art
        taught me thinking outside the box and the impact of details, managing a
        small business taught me the need for delivering exceptional results. If
        your team is in search of a self-taught developer with a military
        background, management skills, and an art portfolio, contact me! Digital
        marvels start with a strong team!
